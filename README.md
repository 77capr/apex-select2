APEX Select2 Plugin
===================

Select lists in Oracle APEX as they should be

##About

The Select2 APEX plugin is based on [Select2](https://select2.github.io/);
an open-source jQuery plugin that greatly improves the functionality and user-friendliness of regular select lists.
In Oracle Application Express, it serves as a replacement for three pre-defined item types:

* Select list
* Shuttle
* Text field with autocomplete
